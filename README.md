## Summary Analysis:

ComSyn is a computer store that aims to recommend and sell laptops to gamers, students and members of the workforce to satisfy their needs. In addition to this they also recommend all purpose laptops. Instead of custom building or ordering new laptops they make these recommendations based on their inventory, if their inventory is unsuitable for the customerâ€™s needs, the recommended laptop for purpose is displayed and listed as out of stock or special order only. ComSyn allows their customers to browse these categories based on the purpose of the laptop.
